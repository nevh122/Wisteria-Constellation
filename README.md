<br>
A third-person psychological horror-adventure, puzzle RPG following the story of two boys, Rigel and Leo, people with no recollection of how they ended up trapped in the world of stars named Axies. Together they try to escape the mystical world, meeting stars along the way and learning a bit of themselves back as they venture deeper and deeper into Axies. This game embarks into the adventure of Rigel and Leo that features sensitive themes that revolve around their life, traumas, and coping mechanisms while also finding healing, hope, and connection with each other.
